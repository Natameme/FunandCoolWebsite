<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

<p>
For me, it's the Github. The best GIT-based Code version manager.
I even ask for extra data packets and the staff is so friendly and
more than willing to oblige. One time I asked for Data sauce packets
and they gave me three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice
friendly Github worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!".
Now the staff greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS give
me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local Github
repository, I go there at least 3 times a week for debugging and a large
joke project with Python instead of C, 1-2 times for browsing on the
weekend, and maybe once for <s>stealing code</s> crowdsourcing issues
when I'm in a rush but want a great website that is affordable, fast,
and can match my daily computational needs. I even dip my computer in Data sauce,
it's delicious! What a great website.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<div> I used internal CSS to create the bounding boxes, font style and colors of
the text elements, just as well, I used CSS to tesselate the fun gif you can see
across the background of the screen. One hurdle was the fact that I was not in class
last week, so the creation of this page HEAVILY references the HTML and CSS Tutorials
at www.w3schools.com Including code from

<ul>
<li>https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp</li>
<li>https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp</li>
